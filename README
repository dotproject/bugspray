ABOUT

    The purpose of this project is to extend the current implementation of HelpDesk, 
    adding features and filters that will allow it to be used as a full bug tracking
    solution. This project is currently a fork of the HelpDesk project but the end
    goal of the project is to remerge with Helpdesk to offer a complete Bug and issue
    tracking package.
